Hey there! My name is Joana Matilde Neto, and I'm a passionate software developer with a love for creating innovative solutions. With a background in computer science, I finished my bachelor's in 2024. Throughout the years I have specialized in web development, mobile applications and even games.

When I'm not on my pc, you can find me at the gym, in a park drawing some doodles, or reading fictional books (very open for book suggestions of any kind though, I love to explore). I'm always eager to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.
